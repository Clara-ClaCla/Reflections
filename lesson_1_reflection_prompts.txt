How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    focus on changed lines to spot the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Trying to implement using a method to later found that another method will
    be better.  Reverting to older version.  Clients love to change their mind
    with their functions, can revert or grab back old implementation.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro - you have control over when to commit on the progress of your coding
    cons - forgetting to save or if things crashed, you get a copy

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A project consists a lot of files combined together.
    Documents written in Google are individual.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log - view the comments to get an idea what has changed in that versions.
    It helps a lot when you need check the codes.
    Git diff - know the location of the differences can pinpoint the code that
    we want to use for the current working project.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If a bug is introduced, but not sure which commit introduced it.
    we can always go back to the older commits.
    Explore significant changes to the code base - architecture  and differences at the
    low level without breaking the entire project and trying to make it work again.
    With version control - I can rethink code base
    the idea with exploration
    without - little iteration of improvement

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Code with out too much worrying breaking the current version.
    I can always revert back.
